# camagru
Instragram-like website in PHP/JS/MySQL that allows users to take pictures using a webcam and add filters.


To use Camagru (local server):

- git clone in your dedicated solution stack directory

- establish connection with SQL server

- listen on local server. 
You can use command line PHP -S localhost:8080, then go to localhost:8080/index.php using your browser (google chrome much prefered !)
